# nawa

Not another weather app (but it is).

A single page React app (SPA) for checking the weather. It uses [Nomanatim](https://nominatim.org/) for the geocding
and the [National Weather Service API](https://api.weather.gov/) for weather data.

[Check it out](https://tshrestha.github.io/nawa/). It looks better on a mobile device.
