# condies

Short for conditions (as in _weather_ conditions).

A single page ~~React~~ (originally in React but I wanted to try out Solid) [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/) app (
SPA) for checking the weather.

It uses [Nomanatim](https://nominatim.org/) for the geocding and the [National Weather Service API](https://api.weather.gov/)(NWS) for weather data.

[Check it out](https://tshrestha.github.io/conies). It looks better on a mobile device.
